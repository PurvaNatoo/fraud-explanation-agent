- Reported income alone is not a reliable indicator of low fraud risk.
- Very high similarity between applicant name and email may indicate auto-generated or short-lived email usage.
- Limited address history can reduce confidence in applicant stability.
- Unusual application volume from the same ZIP code within a short time window may indicate coordinated activity.
- High requested financial exposure combined with limited applicant maturity increases fraud risk.
